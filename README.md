# What is this?

The API, of course.

# Yeah, but the API for what?

Yes.

# Huh?

Monkey-patching.

# I don't follow.

This is where I throw the serverside stuff for whatever I'm working on. Right now there's not much here and it's written in Python because I have pleb-tier hosting and it was either this or PHP. I tell myself that maybe someday I'll rewrite this as an express app, but who am I kidding?

# Oh, ok.

Yeah, not as cool as you were expecting.

# How to use it:

Don't.
